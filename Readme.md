# A back-end platform for games.

* **Self-hosted**. You have full control of the system. That makes it cheaper and a lot easier to modify.
* **Scalable**. It's designed to handle high load, because each node can be scaled horizontally. 
* **Unified**. Each service follow standards so service behaviour is predictable and making a new one is easy.
* **Environmental**. You can have a set of completely different environments that never interact each other.
* **Universal**. It can handle any type of games, even a different games at the same time.
* **A platform**. Not just a complete solution, it's a platform. You can easily create a new component that meets your exact requirements.
